        <h2>Colors</h2>
        <p>In web development there are hundreds, if not thousands of color pallets to use
            when making your web application. If I am being honest, to find a lot of these 
            colors you could simply remember your days drawing/coloring in kindergarten,or 
            you could use google (a web developers best friend) and find colors that you would 
            never have imagined to find. Here is three colors that are common use in 
            web development: 
            <ul>
                <li id="red">Red  Hex Value: #ff0000</li>
                <li id="green">Green  Hex Value:#008000</li>
                <li id="blue">Blue  Hex Value: #0000ff</li>
            </ul>      
        </p> 
        <p>To find more colors and color pallets, I use the 
             <a class="color-link" href = "https://palettes.shecodes.io/">She Codes</a> website. I would highly
            recommend this to anyone!   </p>

    <h2>Typography</h2>
    <p>Typography is important in web development. It gives the the developer the ability 
        to make sure their application contains readability for its viewers. Typography, is
        the art of arranging text on a page. Readability is very important and along with 
        the information provided, visual comfort will keep the viewers focus and attention.

    <p><b>Font-family</b>: There are many fonts to use in your application, some of them are even programmed into 
        your code editor for use. If none of the fonts seemed right for your application you 
        can find more fonts on <a class="google" href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google fonts.</a>
        Here are a few font ideas:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li id="roman">Times New Roman</li>
        <li id="water">Water Brush</li>
        <li id="verdana">Verdana</li>
        <li id="ole">Oleo Script Swash Caps</li>
    </ul>

<p><b>Font-weight</b>:When making your application with different fonts there are ways to make your text appear
    <b>bold</b> or <i>thin</i>. This would be called the font-weight of your text and is ued 
to emphasize your caption and get the point across. </p>
<ul>
    <li><b>The rain in spain falls mainly on the plains.</b></li>
    <li><i>The rain in spain falls mainly on the plains.</i></li>
</ul>
