        <p>In web development there are hundreds, if not thousands of color pallets to use
            when making your web application. If I am being honest, to find a lot of these 
            colors you could simply remember your days drawing/coloring in kindergarten,or 
            you could use google (a web developers best friend) and find colors that you would 
            never have imagined to find. Here is three colors that are common use in 
            web development: 
            <ul>
                <li id="red">Red</li>
                <li id="green">Green</li>
                <li id="blue">Blue</li>
            </ul>      
        </p>
        <p>To find more colors and color pallets, I use the 
             <a class="color-link" href = "https://palettes.shecodes.io/">She Codes</a> website. I would highly
            recommend this to anyone!   </p>
